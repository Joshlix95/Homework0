Homework 0 - Due Thursday, August 25 at 2:20 pm

In this directory, you will find 3 class files and one test file.
Each of the class files has 2 or 3 methods that need to be implemented.
The test cases for all of these methods are in the test file which was written 
using JUnit4. 

I know that Eclipse and IntelliJ will support these without issue. You can just
make a new project and add these files. It looks like Xcode no longer natively
supports java development, but it can be done. If you have already configured
your version of Xcode to support Java, then you should also be able to just create
a new project with these files. I don’t know if it will support the JUnit tests.
jGrasp is another super lightweight java IDE, but I have no experience with it.

If you have any questions or need clarity on how a method should react to certain
inputs, check the test cases or ask me. If you’re having trouble setting up your project in an IDE, come see me.

You don’t need to submit the test cases. Just the three class files will due. You can upload the completed implementations in Moodle.

Good luck!
